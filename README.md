## Group 9 - Automobile Accident Predictor

#### Objective:

The objective of our project is going to be to create an automobile danger predictor. Our model will take in parameters discussed in the data source section and classify the level of danger. The outputs of our model will be binary indicating whether there is high, medium or low danger. 

#### Data Source:

The data source we plan on using is a road accident dataset collected by the UK government from 2000 to 2018. They recorded over 1.8 million accidents measuring several features. As part of our model we plan on exploring some of the relationships between these features and looking at the severity of the accident. A higher severity crash level for us will equal a higher danger level. 

Some of feature we plan on exploring in this dataset are:
Number of vehicles
Date
Time
Day of week
Road type 
Speed limit
Weather conditions
Road surface conditions
